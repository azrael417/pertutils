# pertutils
This repository contains some optimized implementation of functions from perturbative QCD (such as the beta function) or effective field theories
(e.g. finite volume correction formulas, Luscher Zeta function).
It is compiled in a dynamic library and can used by other programs. I am going to provide a doxygen documentation soon.
